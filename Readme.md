# RFI: Precursors (Unity Edition)

This is a throw-back to our original Precursors C++ client, rewritten entirely 
in Unity, as a project for me to learn Unity with.

## Background

The last official build of (any iteration of) Precursors we last released was
`v0.3.3`. It had:

* Some (wonky) Physics
* The Ares model
* Engine glow
* Firing of a single plasma ball
* Mouse Look movement
* The first version of our "Asteroids Level"
* _No networking_

To get there, it took us ~700 commits, and 582 days. I've recreated it (except 
for the GUI) in Unity in about 8 hours.

Needless to say, that was a bit humbling.

Ok, so let's kick it up a notch, and throw in the GUI, and maybe get it as far 
as any version of the project has _EVER_ gotten?

## What this project _is not_

This is _not_ a return to active work on Precursors. Sure, I might be able to, 
on my own, get further than the project has ever gotten, but that doesn't mean
that I can take it anywhere near "complete". There's a lot of fundamentals 
missing, and a lot of flaws with the initial concept. Precursors as envisioned
in 2004 will never come to be.

## What this project _is_

So why do this at all? Well, that's easy: Precursors has always been a Siren 
for me to chase, an idea that has burned in my brain for a long, long time. So 
I have a lot of love for the long hours we put into writing our crappy code 
and learning how to build games. This is nostalgic for me, so I love seeing it 
in a new light.

But, at the end of the day, this is an example project for me to learn Unity 
and figure out how to build a _real_ game in it.
