# RFI: Precursors (Unity Edition)

This is a throw-back to our original Precursors C++ client, rewritten entirely 
in Unity, as a project for me to learn Unity with.

## Background

The last official build of (any iteration of) Precursors we last released was
`v0.3.3`. It had:

* Some (wonky) Physics
* The Ares model
* Engine glow
* Firing of a single plasma ball
* Mouse Look movement
* The first version of our "Asteroids Level"
* Basic GUI
* _No networking_

To get there, it took us ~700 commits, and 582 days. I recreated it (except 
for the GUI) in Unity in about 8 hours. Doing a simple (not beat for beat) GUI 
(based on our old sprite sheet and some re-exported SVGs) added another 6 
hours to the total.

Needless to say, that was a bit humbling.

### And now?

Ok, so I said to my self, let's kick it up a notch, and maybe get it as far as 
any version of the project has _EVER_ gotten? That means networked multiplayer 
and chat.

The networking never _really_ worked over the internet, so let's just call it 
'local multiplayer'.

## What this project _is not_

This is _not_ a return to active work on Precursors. Sure, I might be able to, 
on my own, get further than the project has ever gotten, but that doesn't mean
that I can take it anywhere near "complete". There's a lot of fundamentals 
missing, and a lot of flaws with the initial concept. Precursors as envisioned
in 2004 will never come to be.

Another point: This is _not_ a game. Not in a technical sense; there's no win 
condition, and no lose condition. The original never had one, so I am not 
going to add one in this version.

## What this project _is_

This is tribute to all the iterations of this game that have ever existed. I'm 
using assets from every version, some because they're better, others because 
It's all i've had.

_None of the assets_ in this is fully original to this version, all of it are 
just modified versions of old items. That's intentional, and desired; as I 
said, this is a tribute, not an active project; I want everything to be 
recycled bits and ideas from our unfinished attempts.

So why do this at all? Well, that's easy: Precursors has always been a unicorn 
for me to chase, an idea that has burned in my brain for a long, long time. So 
I have a lot of love for the long hours we put into writing our crappy code 
and learning how to build games. This is nostalgic for me, so I love seeing it 
in a new light.

But, at the end of the day, this is an example project for me to learn Unity 
and figure out how to build a _real_ game in it.

## The Future

This particular code base, and everything contained in this repository is 
probably destined for the dustbin. While nostalgic, representing thousands of 
man hours... it was all temporary. We knew we weren't good at models, or 
textures, or UI.

_But_ this unicorn, the idea it represents will live on, and give birth to a 
lot of other things. Hell, all of my professional carreer is built on the back 
of this game. In a way, everything I've ever done with code has been to 
further this project. So no, it's not dead. Not even a little

_Unicorns can never die._
